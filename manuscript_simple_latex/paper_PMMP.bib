              the milliseconds to seconds time regime. Protein phosphorylation
              is probably the most important of these modifications as it
              affects protein structure and interactions, critically
              influencing the life cycle of a cell. In the last 15 years, new
              insights into phosphorylation have been provided by highly
              sensitive MS-based approaches combined with specific
              phosphopeptide enrichment strategies. Although so far research
              has mainly focused on the discovery and characterization of

abstract = {Analysis of the phosphoproteome by MS has become a key technology for the characterization of dynamic regulatory processes in the cell, since kinase and phosphatase action underlie many major biological functions. However, the addition of a phosphate group to a suitable side chain often confounds informatic analysis by generating product ion spectra that are more difficult to interpret (and consequently identify) relative to unmodified peptides. Collectively, these challenges have motivated bioinformaticians to create novel software tools and pipelines to assist in the identification of phosphopeptides in proteomic mixtures, and help pinpoint or “localize” the most likely site of modification in cases where there is ambiguity. Here we review the challenges to be met and the informatics solutions available to address them for phosphoproteomic analysis, as well as highlighting the difficulties associated with using them and the implications for data standards.},

Percolator's processing speed has been sufficient for typical data sets consisting of hundreds of thousands of PSMs. With our new scalable approach, we can now also analyze millions of PSMs in a matter of minutes on a commodity computer. Furthermore, with the increasing awareness for the need for reliable statistics on the protein level, we compared several easy-to-understand protein inference methods and implemented the best-performing method---grouping proteins by their corresponding sets of theoretical peptides and then considering only the best-scoring peptide for each protein---in the Percolator package. We used Percolator 3.0 to analyze the data from a recent study of the draft human proteome containing 25 million spectra (PM:24870542).

abstract = {Mathematical software and graph-theoretical algorithmic packages to efficiently model, analyze, and query graphs are crucial in an era where large-scale spatial, societal, and economic network data are abundantly available. One such package is JGraphT, a programming library that contains very efficient and generic graph data structures along with a large collection of state-of-the-art algorithms. The library is written in Java with stability, interoperability, and performance in mind. A distinctive feature of this library is its ability to model vertices and edges as arbitrary objects, thereby permitting natural representations of many common networks, including transportation, social, and biological networks. Besides classic graph algorithms such as shortest-paths and spanning-tree algorithms, the library contains numerous advanced algorithms: graph and subgraph isomorphism, matching and flow problems, approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems such as independent set and the traveling salesman problem, and several more exotic algorithms such as Berge graph detection. Due to its versatility and generic design, JGraphT is currently used in large-scale commercial products, as well as noncommercial and academic research projects.In this work, we describe in detail the design and underlying structure of the library, and discuss its most important features and algorithms. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance of JGraphT versus several similar libraries. Experiments on a large number of graphs over a variety of popular algorithms show that JGraphT is highly competitive with other established libraries such as NetworkX or the BGL.},

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Database search engines are the preferred method to
              identify peptides in mass spectrometry data. However, valuable
              software is in this context not only defined by a powerful
              algorithm to separate correct from false identifications, but
              also by constant maintenance and continuous improvements.
              METHODS: In 2014, we presented our peptide identification
              algorithm MS Amanda, showing its suitability for identifying
              peptides in high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and its
              ability to outperform widely used tools to identify peptides.
              Since then, we have continuously worked on improvements to
              enhance its usability and to support new trends and developments
              in this fast-growing field, while keeping the original scoring
              algorithm to assess the quality of a peptide spectrum match
              unchanged. RESULTS: We present the outcome of these efforts, MS
              Amanda 2.0, a faster and more flexible standalone version with
              the original scoring algorithm. The new implementation has led to
              a 3-5$\times$ speedup, is able to handle new ion types and
              supports standard data formats. We also show that MS Amanda 2.0
              works best when using only the most common ion types in a
              particular search instead of all possible ion types. CONCLUSIONS:

              data in conjunction with the respective peptide sequences to
              calculate site probabilities for all potential phosphorylation
              sites. Tandem mass spectra from synthetic phosphopeptides were
              used for optimization of the scoring parameters employing all
              commonly used fragmentation techniques. Calculation of
              probabilities was adapted to the different fragmentation methods
              and to the maximum mass deviation of the analysis. The software

              matching experimental data to the theoretical values of all
