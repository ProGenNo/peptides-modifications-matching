Python implementation and related files of the algorithm proposed in the article "A graph-based approach for modification site assignment in proteomics" (preprint: <ins>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17755</ins>)

Graph modeling approach that considers the possibilities of modifications occurring at specific sites of the amino acid chains, and returns the most likely modification sites with controlled processing time.
